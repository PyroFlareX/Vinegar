# Vinegar
 My 2D/3D rendering engine. Requires C++ 14. It ***attempts*** to follow the code it yourself philosophy, 

# Libraries
 Uses GLFW 3.3, glm, glad (with OpenGL), OpenVR(for interfacing with steamvr), and bullet physics as of writing.
 Planning to use these libraries in the future:  
-	Networking:		enet
-	Audio:			OpenAL or opus (depending on platform)
-	Scripting:		Python embedding in C++
	
# Building
 ***TEMPORARY*** The current build system is, well, the default Visual Studio 2017 build system. Before compiling, make sure to change the Additional Includes and Additional Libraries directories.  
  
 ***New Build System, not yet implemented.*** The new system will use cmake. Example is not yet done.  

## Windows
 Tested to be working.  
 
## Linux
 *Should* work.
